# Just In Time

**Just In Time** is a precision-based timing game built with **React**, using **Hooks** (`useRef`, `useState`, `useImperativeHandle`) and **Portals** to test your internal clock. Featuring a custom **"Cyber-Neon" Gaming UI** with high-contrast visuals and glitch animations, the app calculates your accuracy in real-time to provide a precise score upon completion. The entire experience is built with a **mobile-first** approach.
